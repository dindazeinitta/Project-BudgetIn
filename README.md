## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run the BudgetIn project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dindazeinitta/Project-BudgetIn.git
cd Project-BudgetIn
``` 

### 2. Run the Frontend

Since the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can open the signup.html or index.html directly in a browser. Alternatively, if you prefer a live preview:

- VS Code: Install the Live Server extension.

- Right-click on signup.html (or index.html)

- And select Open with Live Server.

This will start a local server and you can view the site at http://localhost:5500 or whatever port Live Server uses.


### 3. Run the Backend
```
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
or

```
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```
